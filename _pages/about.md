Welcome to the research homepage of Yuhui Song, a passionate science & engineering undergraduate student specializing in Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation Engineering at [the China University of Petroleum, Beijing](https://www.cup.edu.cn/). With a strong foundation in mathmetics, mathmetic-physics, data-driven methods, reinforcement learning, deep learning and structure engineering, Yuhui's research primarily focuses on addressing critical cutting-edge challenges in the energy sector, particularly the safety of pipelines and the efficiency of transporting oil and gas. He always tries his best to build some underlying strutures for energy industries, which combines math, physics, machine learning and engineering. His dream is to be like Stephen Wolfram to build the useful and basic structure just like Wolfram Mathematica for the energy industry.

Viribus Unitis Semper Fidelis
======
**Coniungite, vos somniorum venatores totius orbis terrarum, et una ad astra contendite!**

1. **The Chinese mathematical community cannot be absent from Bourbaki!**  
   I am translating and providing an in-depth analysis of the *Éléments de Mathématique* by the Bourbaki school, much like previous generations of physicists translated Lev Landau's *Course of Theoretical Physics*. Those proficient in French, German, or English and passionate about mathematics are welcome to join!

2. **Modern mathematical physics must not abandon its classical roots!**  
   I am integrating and offering detailed analysis of classical theories from 19th-century mathematical physics, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework akin to the *Éléments de Mathématique*. Mathematicians, physicists, and experts in mathematical physics are invited to collaborate!

3. **Modern engineering must not be limited by rigid frameworks!**  
   I am developing a complete computational framework for energy engineering, particularly in oil and gas storage and transportation, similar to the flexibility of Wolfram Mathematica. Mechanical engineers, energy engineers, and computer scientists are encouraged to contribute!

4. **Systems science must not remain theoretical!**  
   I am researching the emergence and causal inference mechanisms in complex systems, with the rigor of Einstein’s work on relativity. Experts in neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning are welcome to join this exploration!

5. **Economics must not ignore quantification!**  
   I am establishing a precise set of definitions and standards for quantifying political economy, akin to von Neumann's modeling of game theory. Scholars in economics, political science, and political economy are invited to participate!

6. **Political science must not remain idle in theory!**  
   I am systematically interpreting and compiling classical political theories, much like David Harvey’s work in political theory analysis. Researchers in political science, social sciences, and social philosophy are welcome to join in this endeavor!
